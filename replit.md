- **Lighthouse Configuration**: Device-specific analysis with proper throttling
- **Parallel Processing**: Simultaneous mobile/desktop analysis and screenshot capture
- **Intelligent Fallback**: SEO-focused analysis when browser automation unavailable
- **PDF Generation**: jsPDF and html2canvas integration for visual report exports
- **Error Handling**: Robust browser management and analysis failure recovery
- **Type Safety**: Updated TypeScript definitions for comprehensive analysis results

The application provides complete web performance analysis with professional PDF reporting capabilities, maintaining full functionality even when Lighthouse/Puppeteer are unavailable in restricted environments.
